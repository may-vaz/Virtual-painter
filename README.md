# Virtual-painter

This is a simple Python project that lets you draw on your screen using only your hand gestures, without touching the screen or using a mouse. It uses your webcam to detect your hand and tracks the tip of your index finger to draw smooth lines on a virtual canvas. You can also change the drawing color by hovering your finger over on-screen buttons (Red, Green, Blue) or clear the canvas by selecting the 'Clear' button. The project uses OpenCV for capturing video, NumPy for canvas operations, and MediaPipe for hand detection and landmark tracking.
